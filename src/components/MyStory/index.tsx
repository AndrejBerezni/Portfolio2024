          My journey into IT began in <span className="text-brand">2018</span>,
          starting with tech support and gradually moving up to become a{' '}
          <span className="text-brand">cloud data migration expert</span>. Along
          the way, I&apos;ve always been curious about how things work,
          especially in development. I found that web development really lets me
          flex my creativity and problem-solving skills.

          I started out focusing on the{' '}
          <span className="text-brand">front end</span>, but soon realized I
          enjoyed working on all parts of web apps. So, I taught myself{' '}
          <span className="text-brand">back end</span> development too. Learning
          never stops in this field, and I&apos;m always picking up new things
          and getting better at what I already know.
